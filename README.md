# LaneChanger
Lane control for Cities: Skylines

What works:
- Editing lane flags to select Left/Right/Forward.  This updates the graphics.

What doesn't work:
- The cars do not obey the new lane flags.

TODO:
- Make the cars obey the flags
- Remove non-vehicle lanes from the UI
- Highlight the lane that's being changed when you hover over a button
- Add appropriate props (no turn signs, etc)
